structure: 
one file for root
groups: patient identification code
datasets per group: LEFT/RIGHT CC/MLO (np arrays), PATIENT_INFO (python dict) 
array attrs = all criteria [1-8 for CC, 1-9 for MLO], view acceptable, # rows/columns, pixel spacing - Not sure if anything in private tags is useful, read up on what's there and ask Eugene 
dict attrs = age, height, weight (lbs vs kg?), BMI, type of exam done (diagnostique vs screening?), breast size/shape,
		particular conditions, skin markers, compared with prior exam?, views acceptable, overall acceptable

Each DICOM file has a study, series, acquisition, and content time - can match that to the excel spreadsheet
Do these values differ in some files? Assume not?

Some directories might have more than 4 images per date - process these directories (log their names) and go through them afterwards?

PROCESS:
1 - For every patient, find the right scans (using date of examination in spreadsheet)
	a - if a patient is missing a scan (maybe SimpleITK can't open it) leave it out - keep partial data on the subject
	b - if patient is missing all scans, go next patient (don't bother recording patient info)
2 - Once we have the right scans for LEFT/RIGHT CC/MLO save scans as datasets, put patient info and scan data from spreadsheet as attrs
